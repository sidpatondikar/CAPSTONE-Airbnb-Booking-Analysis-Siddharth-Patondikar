##### Key Insights & Recommendations:
- Most of the room type in the city are either entire apartment or private room. This shows the demand is high, and people choosing airbnb prefer privacy.
- Most people are booking rooms under price $500. So we should focus on improving experience in that price range.
- Availability of days for private rooms should be increased in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Host having shared rooms should decrease their average availability as it has the least demand.
- People stay longest in apartments and it also generates most revenue. Shared rooms has longer stays then private rooms, so if hosts improve the experience of shared rooms, it might lead to greater revenues from shared rooms.
- Queens, Bronx and Staten Island should look into decreasing the prices for entire apartment to attract visitors.

##### Key Insights & Recommendations:
- Manhattan and Brooklyn has the most number of room listings. More focus should be given on increasing the room listings in Queens, Bronx and Staten Island.
- Manhattan and Brooklyn has properties around a wide price range so it attracts all kind of visitors. Other neighbourhood groups can see and increase variety as well.
- City officials can learn from Fort Wadsworth as to what factors make it the most expensive area to rent.
- Manhattan and Brooklyn are central locations in the city, this is one factor that leads to more demand and visitors. City officials should implement better transport, entertainment and facilities in other neighbourhood groups to attract visitors there.
- We can drive traffic away from Manhattan for entire apartments with better transport, cheaper price and similar facilities in other neighbourhood groups.
- As room price decrease as we move away from centre, city officials should leverage this to make other parts of city better.
