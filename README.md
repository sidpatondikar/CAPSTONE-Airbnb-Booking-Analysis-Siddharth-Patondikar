## Project Summary

Airbnb is an online marketplace that allows individuals to rent out their homes, apartments, or rooms to travelers. Founded in 2008, the platform has grown to become one of the largest hospitality companies in the world, with over 4 million listings in more than 220 countries and regions. Airbnb offers a variety of accommodations, ranging from private rooms in shared apartments to entire houses and villas. The platform has revolutionized the way people travel by providing a more affordable and authentic alternative to traditional hotels, and has had a significant impact on the hospitality industry as a whole.

The "Airbnb Booking Analysis" project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Airbnb New York City data from 2019. The project will involve gathering, cleaning, and analyzing the data to extract insights into the booking patterns of Airbnb guests in New York City.

First the data will be cleaned. The analysis will then be carried out using various visualization and statistical techniques to identify trends and patterns in the data. The project will also explore the relationships between different variables, such as price, location, and neighbourhood, etc. to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that influence Airbnb bookings in New York City.

The insights gained from this analysis can be used by Airbnb hosts and prospective hosts in New York City to optimize their pricing strategies, marketing efforts, and property listings to attract more bookings. Additionally, the analysis can provide valuable insights to city officials and regulators who are interested in understanding the impact of Airbnb on the local economy and housing market. Overall, the "Airbnb Booking Analysis" project has the potential to generate useful insights into the dynamics of the Airbnb market in New York City and inform decision-making for various stakeholders.
